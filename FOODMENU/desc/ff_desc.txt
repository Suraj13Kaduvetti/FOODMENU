Fish Fry:
Fish Fry is a delectable dish that showcases the crispy and flavorful side of seafood. Fish fillets are marinated in a blend of spices, including turmeric, red chili, and cumin, before being coated in a seasoned batter and fried to golden perfection. The result is a crispy exterior that gives way to tender, succulent fish inside. Served with a squeeze of lemon and perhaps a side of chutney, Fish Fry is a popular dish in coastal regions, celebrating the natural flavors of the fish enhanced by the aromatic spices.
