Pav Bhaji:
Pav Bhaji is a beloved Indian street food that combines spiced mashed vegetables, predominantly potatoes and tomatoes, served with soft buttered pav (bread rolls). The vegetables are cooked to a thick consistency, infused with a medley of spices, and garnished with cilantro and a squeeze of lime. This flavorful, colorful mash is then paired with the buttery pav, creating a symphony of tastes and textures. A popular choice for casual dining, Pav Bhaji is a culinary delight that captures the essence of Indian street food culture.
