Dal Makhani:
Dal Makhani is a luscious Punjabi dish that elevates humble lentils to gourmet status. Black lentils and kidney beans are slow-cooked to perfection in a creamy tomato-based sauce enriched with butter and cream. The result is a velvety, indulgent dal with a smoky undertone, thanks to the traditional use of charcoal for flavor infusion. This hearty dish, often accompanied by naan or rice, captivates with its rich and comforting texture, making it a favorite across India and beyond.
