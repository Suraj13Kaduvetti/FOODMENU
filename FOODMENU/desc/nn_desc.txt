Nihari Gosht:
Nihari Gosht is a slow-cooked stew, originating from the Mughlai cuisine of India, featuring tender pieces of meat, often beef or lamb, in a rich and spiced broth. The dish is slow-cooked overnight, allowing the meat to absorb the flavors of the aromatic spices. Traditionally eaten as a breakfast item, Nihari Gosht is often garnished with ginger, green chilies, and fresh coriander. The resulting stew is a hearty, flavorful dish that exemplifies the dedication to slow cooking and the artistry of spice blending in Indian culinary traditions.
