RasMalai:
RasMalai is a divine Indian dessert featuring soft, flattened cheese patties soaked in a cardamom-infused, saffron-tinged milk syrup. The delicate patties, known as "malai," are made from chhena (paneer) and gently poached before being immersed in the sweetened milk. Garnished with slivers of pistachios or almonds, RasMalai is a luxurious treat that combines the creamy texture of the cheese with the fragrant sweetness of the milk. Served chilled, this dessert epitomizes the finesse of Indian sweets, offering a sensory experience that is both elegant and indulgent.
